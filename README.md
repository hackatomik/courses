## What

Made by hackers, for hackers. Those who think traditional school is not enough. This is a guide to hack education.

Here you will find guides to study university subjects, but with a hands-on approach.

## Why

Nowadays, traditional education is not enough. This is the case for LATAM and many other places world-wide. Teachers don't use to give a good purpose or motivation for their classes, hence students can't see the real value of what they are studying.

This has to change.

We are working to give a better and more meaningful education for mathematics and computer science. Both university topics and other must-to-know emerging technologies. This is the future of education that we are building together.

## How

This curriculum has two comprehensive guides: `uniü¶Ñ`, the university-oriented learning path, and `hackerüêß`, for those who want even more.

Both are designed to provide a hands-on learning with real-world case studies. We want to make mathematics and computer science education fun, but furthermore, useful.
